# What this project is
This project was initiated through using express.js.  I worked through working on a local host and then pushed the app to heroku.  It utilizes handlebars and the MVC model.

# But why?
This application has helped me understand how to utilize the model view controller and object-relational mapping.

# How to use it
Make a burger you want to eat, and then DEVOUR it!
